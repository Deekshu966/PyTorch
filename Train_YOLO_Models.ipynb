        "Now that the data is organized and the config file is created, we're ready to start training! First, there are a few important parameters to decide on. Visit my article on [Training YOLO Models Locally](https://www.ejtech.io/learn/train-yolo-models) to learn more about these parameters and how to choose them.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are several YOLO11 models sizes available to train, including `yolo11n.pt`, `yolo11s.pt`, `yolo11m.pt`, `yolo11l.pt`, and `yolo11xl.pt`. Larger models run slower but have higher accuracy, while smaller models run faster but have lower accuracy. I made a brief YouTube video that compares performance of different YOLO models on a Raspberry Pi 5 and a laptop with a RTX 4050 GPU, [check it out here to get a sense of their speed accuracy](https://youtu.be/_WKS4E9SmkA). If you aren't sure which model size to use, `yolo11s.pt` is a good starting point.\n",

The best amount of epochs to use depends on the size of the dataset and the model architecture. If your dataset has less than 200 images, a good starting point is 60 epochs. If your dataset has more than 200 images, a good starting point is 40 epochs.\n",

YOLO models are typically trained and inferenced at a 640x640 resolution. However, if you want your model to run faster or know you will be working with low-resolution images, try using a lower resolution like 480x480.\n"
